# R-Parser
EXIF Data Processor with Initial MOV/MP4 Support!

This is a simple C# app which takes the current file name of a JPEG/JPG, PNG, HEIC, or MOV/MP4 file and, upon checking its metadata for a date created or earliest access date (whichever comes first), renames the file to that date, with a preference for the date created. This allows for easy sorting of photos and videos in most gallery apps and, indeed, in most file systems when sorting by "name", which is what I was having trouble with. 

As a relatively new developer, there are no doubt bugs and/or features one may wish to request--feel free to create a pull request or report an issue and I will look into it!

I plan on supporting more file formats and Mac/Linux enviornments as well. Learning about said enviornments is probably helpful before I start trying to write software for it, though.
